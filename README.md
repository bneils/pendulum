# Pendulum
This is a 3D simple pendulum simulation in 2D. As far as I know, the only difference between 3D and 2D is drag.

You may edit the constants in `main.cpp` if you wish to tweak things such as initial mass, position, diameter, and the drag coefficient.

Drag frontal area is currently calculated as `pi(r^2)`.
